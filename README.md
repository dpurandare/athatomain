COBOL code translator

WIP: Please bear with me till I finish the README.

Introduction:
Project to develop translator for COBOL to Java or any such language.
Status: The Lexer, Parser, and experimental Generator are available. 

Dependencies:
1. I used Netbeans (for C++) as it allows native debugging of Lex and Yacc (Flex/Bison) code. The makefiles are created by Netbeans and are compatible with with Make (I tried in MacOS and Windows with MingW). I am using VS Code for editing these days and works well. If I need any serious debugging I may go back to NetBeans again. I will recommend using NetBeans so that setting the build toolchains is easier. 
2. The C++ code is compliant to C++11. I have not tried with newer releases.
3. Additional libraries used: Boost (can be found at https://www.boost.org), PugiXML(added as source)
